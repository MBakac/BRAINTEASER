Question answering tasks have long been a central challenge within NLP.
This paper presents our approach to tackling the Sentence Puzzle task in the SemEval-2024 
Task 9 competition: "BRAIN-TEASER: A Novel Task Defying Common Sense."
Diverging from the conventional multi-class classification framework, we introduce a novel pairwise comparison methodology.
Instead of forcing the model to choose the correct answer from four options, we reformulate the task into multiple decisions, evaluating triplets of answers at a time.
This approach aims to make the model more robust to distractory and enhance the model's reasoning capabilities and accuracy.
%This approach, inspired by the efficiency of One-vs-One and One-vs-Rest strategies, aims to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities and accuracy.
We compare results using this method and previously explored reformulations of multiple choice as a multi-class classification problem and a series of binary classification choices.
We aim to find out which of these ways of \emph{asking} BERT a multiple choice question works best on what task -- SemEval SentencePuzzle and WordPuzzle.
Our results showcase that the pairwise approach yields worse results than the multi-class classification approach, but better than the binary classification approach on both problems.
