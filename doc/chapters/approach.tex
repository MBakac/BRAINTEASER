We preform a transformation of the questions in the following way. Each tuple of a question and 
its candidate answers
$$
    (Q,A,B,C,D)
$$
gets transformed into three tuples:

\begin{align*}
       (Q,A,B,D), \\
       (Q,A,C,D), \\
       (Q,B,C,D).
\end{align*}
In this way we have no ambiguity with the ground truth labels, for example if the correct answer was
$C$, then the ground truth label in the tuple $(Q,A,B,D)$ is $D$  (None of the above).
