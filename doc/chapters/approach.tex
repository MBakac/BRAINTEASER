We preform a transformation of the questions in the following way. Each tuple of a question and 
its candidate answers
$$
    (Q,A,B,C,D)
$$
gets transformed into four tuples:

\begin{align*}
       (Q,A,B,C), \\ 
       (Q,A,B,D), \\
       (Q,A,C,D), \\
       (Q,B,C,D).
\end{align*}
In this way we forced the model to compare pairs of candidate answers with each other.
