To conclude, we have implemented and tested a new method for reformulating multiple-choice questions.
Our pairwise approach performed better than the binary classification reformulation but worse than the multiclass classification reformulation.
For further research we suggest looking into other possible reformulations, expanding the dataset and using more fine-tuned models.
